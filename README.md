Tracking the development of the website for artist, Zae Lay Low.

GOAL: Design website with similar theme following the design plans of the artist, and 
allow for good UI/UX experience to make viewers want to engage with the artist more.
Have navigation links at the page for:
  MUSIC - Contains a scrollable overlay that allows for viewing of singles and 
  EPs/Albums, and will include a preview button to play a few seconds if necessary.
  ABOUT - Contains an overlay with a description of the artist based on the artist's
  given description.
  CONTACT - A contact form that allows viewers to email the artist and get in contact.
  More features can be added such as social media links, etc.
  NEWSLETTER - A small "Sign Up" button that allows the user to input their email for
  signing up for the newsletter. The newsletter can contain email updates for certain
  timeframes, updates on musical releases, or anything the artist would want in a 
  newsletter.
The background would be the music video for "0 Celsius".

PROGRESS: Developed the front-end website, still editing for mobile responsiveness and
widescreen responsiveness. With approval of the artist, will design a newsletter using 
AWS that follows on the visions of the artist.
